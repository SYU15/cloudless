# Documentation

This project uses https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown to generate
the documentation, currently off a fork at
https://github.com/sverch/pydoc-markdown.

To generate the docs, run `pydocmd build`.  To view them locally, run `pydocmd
serve`, and to deploy them run `pydocmd gh-deploy`.

The `sources` directory has the documentation that is not auto generated.
